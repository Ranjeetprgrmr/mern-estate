// I completed the MERN Stack training program at Broadway and had a great experience. The curriculum was well-structured and covered all essential aspects of the MERN Stack. I worked on various projects, including an e-commerce website, food delivery app, and blog app. The instructors provided excellent support and feedback, helping me improve my coding skills. I learned to view errors and bugs as opportunities for growth and learning, and to approach problems with a logical and methodical mindset. I highly recommend this program to anyone looking to acquire MERN Stack skills.
